Version 3.8.2
=============

Bug files:
  - serious problems with step filtering addressed (previously step filtering
    could have caused gaps in step numbering, breaking normal navigation). 
    Complete overhaul of step numbering system implemented.

  - empty front page message caused erroneous HASH address display in generated
    front page.

  - code-level readability improvements.

Additions:
  - [bug 7] support for objectives and outcomes added.
 
  - documentation for <outcomes>, <outcome>, <objectives>, and <objective>
    metadata elements added.

Version 3.8
===========

Bug fixes:
  - Filter list is cleared before requesting a new list, prevents users from 
    selecting filter keywords, changing courses, and then hitting next with
    the old filter selected.

  - Rewording of welcome stage for clarity.
  
Additions:
  - WARNING messages are now copied to separate boxes on the export and process
    stages of the web interface.

  - filtering rules for steps now use step titles rather than ids.

  - full documentation for the web interface and filtering, and upgraded 
    documentation for the rest of the system.

Version 3.7.3
=============

Additions:
  - Processor web interface now supports automatic discovery of filter keywords,
    filtering, and template selection.

Version 3.7.2
=============

Bug fixes:
  - processor.pl and wiki2course.pl now search for external programs as needed.

Additions:
  - [bug 6] Initial version of the processor web interface. Basic features, no
    filtering or template selection facilities.

  - processor.pl and wiki2course.pl now support a --pid argument to write their
    process ID to a file if needed.

Version 3.7.0
=============

Bug fixes:
  - various small fixes to correct behaviour for full release in response to 
    testing.


Version 3.7.0 RC 1
==================

Bug fixes:
  - HTMLOutputHandler::conver_interlink. Corrected step number generation for
    steps less than 10 without a leading zero.

  - [bug 12] missing configuration files will cause perocessor.pl to halt.

  - [bug 33] TWPopup code no longer generates invalid html: all inline content
    is contained within spans, and popup content appended to document body as
    divs.

  - [bug 39] All reads and writes done in wiki2course and processor are done
    via filehandles set to use utf8 encoding.

  - [bug 40] wiki2course will detect and attempt to correct incorrect case in
    the media lists, processor.pl will detect incorrect case use in the
    material and attempt to address it.

Additions:
  - [bug 1] Page transclusion using {{Template}} syntax supported. Full 
    support for all template operations available.
    
  - [bug 2] Media files (images, animations, etc) are now listed on a single 
    Media page.

  - [bug 3] Multiple streamed videos per page are now supported.

  - [bug 4] HTMLOutputHandler now uses the framework directory inside the 
    active template directory to construct the framework for the course. No 
    separate user-maintained framework is needed (effectively, all course 
    content can now be stored within the wiki.)

  - [bug 5] wiki2course now uses mediawiki's API to convert a page from 
    mediawiki markup to html. Complete support for all mediawiki markup is
    now available (including tables).

  - [bug 8] internal documentation has been overhauled to be doxygen
    compatible (requires doxygen perl filter to be installed)

  - [bug 9] wiki2course: local tags may contain wiki links to transclude pages 
    using the syntax [local][[NS:Page]][/local]

  - [bug 16] streamflv is now supported, including multiple streams per page.

  - [bug 17] fixing bug 5 now makes 17 a non-issue (mediawiki will generate 
    the content of the <math> element, and wiki2course downloads the result).

  - [bug 18] fixed as a side effect of bug 5 above. Spash images for streamed
    videos are now supported.

  - [bug 20] <popup> tags are processed by the API (see bug 5 above), and 
    [local] tags are now converted to popups.

  - [bug 21] POD usage information added to both core scripts.

  - [bug 23] Mediawiki templates are fully supported thanks to API-base page
    converstion.

  - [bug 31] All filtering operations are now supported.

  - [bug 32] wiki2course now generates flash tags in html, [anim] generation 
    has been removed.

  - [bug 35] the metadata loader will now autmomatically insert missing 
    leadsto/prerequisite targets as needed to ensure consistent linking.
    (eg: if an author only specifies leadsto relations for the modules in
    a theme, the loader automagically adds the appropriate prerequisites
    relations). This is only done when metadata validation is enabled!

  - [bug 36] wiki2course can now process transclusions at all levels in a 
    course other than the Course: page.

  - new metadata structure and tags available. Please consult the metadata
    documentation: http://elearn.cs.man.ac.uk/devwiki/index.php/Docs:Metadata

  - automatic generation of course maps and the required theme buttons, with 
    the ability for users to set a user-created map to use instead of an 
    auto-generated map if needed.

Others:
  - internal structure of processor.pl has been completely overhauled to be more 
    future-proof and maintainable.

  - running processor.pl at minimum verbosity will present the user with simple
    progress bars indicating processing status, rather than scrolling messages.

  - theme pages should no longer include a == Resources == section: resource 
    handling is now done entirely inside the metadata.

  - if steps are processed with html tidy, any output is cached and the cache
    is printed after processing is complete.
