Bug fixes:
  - HTMLOutputHandler::conver_interlink. Corrected step number generation for
    steps less than 10 without a leading zero.

    is contained within spans, and popup content appended to document body as
    divs.

    does not include full template variable processing.

    page.

  - [bug 3] Multiple streamed videos per page are now supported.

  - [bug 9] wiki2course: local tags may contain wiki links to transclude pages 
    using the syntax [local][[NS:Page]][/local]

  - [bug 17] wiki2course converts <math>...</math> equations to internally 
    supported [latex]$...$[/latex] tags during export.

  - [bug 21] POD usage information added to both core scripts.

  - [bug 32] wiki2course now generates flash tags in html, [anim] generation has 
    been removed.

  - [bug 36] wiki2course can now process transclusions at all levels in a course
    other than the Course: page.

Others:
  - internal structure of processor.pl has been completely overhauled to be more 
    future-proof and maintainable.
